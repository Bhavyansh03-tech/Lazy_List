# Lazy Lists in Jetpack Compose

This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with lazy lists in Jetpack Compose using Kotlin. The primary focus is on implementing LazyColumn, LazyRow, and LazyGrid within an Android application using Android Studio.

In this repository, I have implemented:

- LazyColumn: A vertically scrolling list.
- LazyRow: A horizontally scrolling list.
- LazyGrid: A grid layout that supports lazy loading of items.

## Features

- LazyColumn: Implementation of a vertically scrolling list that efficiently loads items as they come into view.
- LazyRow: Implementation of a horizontally scrolling list with lazy loading.
- LazyGrid: Implementation of a grid layout that loads items lazily to improve performance.
